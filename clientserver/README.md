# Client Server

## Scenario

Include a client and a server in the same trace by sending trace information in the HTTP headers

A starter project is in `exercise` with a solution in `solution`.

## Extra Credit

* Review the headers sent by the client
* Send baggage from the client to the server
* Is there a better way to determine if a trace is active?
